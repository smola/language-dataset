This is a wiki-book like project, intended for helping CST students to build a full, global view of computer science and technology.

CST is the short for Computer Science and Technology, which is a major name in our school.

Knowledge is a journey, not a destination.

A: I use T<sub>E</sub>X, but most of our collaborators use Markdown. So I wrote an automatic build system for them.

Q: Why do you arrange contents like this?  
A: I don't know. I am not so good at computer and text. There must be a lot of contents missing, and a lot of unexplainable content arranging. Hope you fire an issue to help me.
