    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Royal Opera is Swedenâ€™s National Stage for the Opera arts. In 2015 we designed and implemented their new responsive website.
      I was responsible for most of the design and implementation throughout the project and developed content strategies,
      wireframes, style guides and frontend guidelines. The original Royal Opera graphic identity is designed by <i>Stockholm Graphics</i>      and we collaborated to transfer the design, typography and imagery to screens of all sizes.
