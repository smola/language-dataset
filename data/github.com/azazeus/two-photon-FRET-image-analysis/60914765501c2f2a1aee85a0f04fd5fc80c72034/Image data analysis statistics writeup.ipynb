    "Using two-photon techniques for performing FRET-based stoichiometry requires including additional terms as compared to the one photon case. Namely, we cannot ignore the excitation of donor due to the acceptor excitation as well as the emission of acceptor into the donor emission channel. This has been detailed wonderfully in Meredith's thesis and I will not repeat it here. Instead, I will outline the image processing techniques that are used in the data analysis developed by Dan and Amar. The basic algorithm is as follows:\n",
