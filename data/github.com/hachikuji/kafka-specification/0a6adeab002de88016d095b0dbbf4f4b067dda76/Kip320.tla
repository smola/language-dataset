------------------------------- MODULE Kip320 -------------------------------

(** 
 * We failed to fence fetch requests properly, which led to KIP-320. Here is a summary
 * of the basic replication rules that we found while verifying this model.
 *
 * 1) Whenever a follower bumps its epoch, it is required to use the OffsetForLeaderEpoch
 *    API to initialize its log. It must not begin fetching until its log matches the 
 *    leader's log up to the follower's end offset.
 * 2) The truncation phase when a replica is becoming a follower must also be fenced. It is
 *    not safe to use the state of a leader in another epoch to find the truncation point
 *    because that state may change.
 * 3) The leader will only bump the high watermark if followers in the ISR have acknowledged
 *    the leader and its epoch.
 * 4) Shrinking the ISR is generally safe, but expanding it requires caution. In particular,
 *    followers must have at least replicated up to the start of the leader's epoch to
 *    ensure that committed data from a previous epoch cannot be lost.
 *)

LOCAL IsFollowingLeaderEpoch(leader, follower) == 
    /\ ReplicaPresumesLeadership(leader)
    /\ replicaState[follower].leader = leader
    /\ replicaState[follower].leaderEpoch = replicaState[leader].leaderEpoch

(**
 * Followers can fetch as long as they have the same epoch as the leader. Prior to fetching,
 * followers are responsible for truncating the log so that it matches the leader's. The
 * local high watermark is updated at the time of fetching.

       IN   replicaState' = [replicaState EXCEPT ![follower].hw = followerHw]
    /\ UNCHANGED <<nextRecordId, quorumState, nextLeaderEpoch, leaderAndIsrRequests>>

(**
 * The high watermark is advanced if all members of the ISR are following the leader's
 * epoch and have replicated up to the current high watermark. Note that we depend only
 * on the leader's local ISR and not the quorum.

    /\ replicaState' = [replicaState EXCEPT ![leader].hw = @ + 1]
    /\ UNCHANGED <<nextRecordId, replicaLog, quorumState, nextLeaderEpoch, leaderAndIsrRequests>>

(**
 * A replica is taken out of the ISR by the leader if it is not following the right epoch 
 * or if its end offset is lagging. In this model, the decision to shrink the ISR is made 
 * arbitrarily by the leader if either of these conditions is met. It can choose to shrink 
 * the ISR immediately after becoming leader or it can wait indefinitely before doing so.

    IN  \/ hw = 0
        \/ /\ hw > 0
           /\ ReplicaLog!HasOffset(follower, hw - 1)
(**
 * Generally speaking, a replica which has caught up to the high watermark is eligible
 * to join the ISR, but there is one subtlety. When a follower becomes leader, 
 * its high watermark is typically behind the leader. Since it does not know what the true
 * high watermark was at the time the leader failed (or shutdown), it must be conservative 
 * when adding new members to the ISR. We can be assured that all members of the current 
 * ISR have replicated up to whatever the leader's high watermark was, but it is not safe 
 * to assume the same for new replicas until they have replicated ALL of the messages from 
 * the previous leader. In other words, we need to wait until it has at least replicated up
 * to the start of the its own leader epoch.

(**
 * The only improvement here over the KIP-279 truncation logic is that we ensure that the
 * leader and follower have the same epoch. Without it, we violate the strong ISR property
 * when a follower uses a leader with stale state to find the truncation offset. Later
 * the stale leader may do some truncation of its own before catching up to the follower's
 * epoch. You can verify this failure by replacing this action with `BecomeFollowerTruncateKip279`
 * in the spec below.
