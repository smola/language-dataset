Another great feature in Emacs is that if you are not happy with something,
change it. So I want a function that actually fix it at runtime.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun org-latex-export-to-pdf-and-open ()
"Export current buffer to LaTeX then process through to PDF and open the
resulting file"
  (interactive)
  (let* ((file-name (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name))
        (name (file-name-sans-extension file-name)))
  (org-latex-export-to-pdf)
  (find-file (concat name ".pdf"))))
#+END_SRC
